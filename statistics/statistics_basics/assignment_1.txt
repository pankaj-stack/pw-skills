Q1. What is Statistics?
Ans. Statistics is the collection of the collecting,organzing and analyzing of data.

Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.
Ans. Descriptive Statistics:
        It consist of organzing and analyzing of data. 
        ex: 1.measure of central tendency(Mean,Median and Mode)
            2.Measure of dispersion(variance and Standar-deviation) 
            3.Different type of distribution of data.(histogram,pdf,pmf) 
     Inferential Statistics:
        It consist of using data whta you have measured to form conclusion(anumanik statistics) 
        ex: 1.Z-test 
            2.T-test 
            3.Chi-square test 

Q3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of
    each type of data.
Ans. There are two types of data. 
     1.Qualitative
     2.Quantitative 
     Qualitative data is the numerical data while Qualitative is the categorical data.
     
     ex:-> No. of bank accounts,no. of childrens are in a family,Male,Female,good,bad and better etc.

Q5. Explain the concept of levels of measurement and give an example of a variable for each level.
Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an
example to illustrate your answer.
Q7. How nominal data type is different from ordinal data type.
Ans. nominal data type is different from ordinal data type because nominal does not follow the rank while ordingal follows the rank.

Q8. Which type of plot can be used to display data in terms of range?
Ans. Historgram

Q9. Describe the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics. Give an example of each
type of statistics and explain how they are used.

Descriptive and inferential statistics are two major branches of statistics that serve different purposes in data analysis and decision-making. Here's a comprehensive explanation of the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics:

Descriptive Statistics:
Descriptive statistics is concerned with summarizing, organizing, and presenting data in a meaningful and concise manner [2]. It aims to describe the characteristics of a data set and provides insights into the main features of the data without making any inferences about the larger population from which the data is drawn. Descriptive statistics helps researchers and analysts understand the basic properties of the data they are working with.
Key characteristics of descriptive statistics:

Provides summary values and graphical representations to describe the data.
Focuses on measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (range, standard deviation, variance), and other summary statistics.
Deals with the actual data points in the sample without extending conclusions to the population.
No probability calculations are involved in descriptive statistics.
Example of descriptive statistics:
Suppose a researcher collects data on the ages of a sample of individuals. Descriptive statistics would be used to calculate the average age (mean), the spread of ages (standard deviation), and present this information using graphs or tables.

Inferential Statistics:
Inferential statistics, on the other hand, is used to draw conclusions and make inferences about a larger population based on the analysis of a sample from that population [3]. It involves using probability and sampling techniques to make predictions and generalizations about the population characteristics.
Key characteristics of inferential statistics:

Uses sample data to make predictions or inferences about the population.
Involves hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and probability distributions.
Deals with uncertainty and estimates parameters of the population based on the sample data.
Allows researchers to make generalizations and draw conclusions beyond the sample data.
Example of inferential statistics:
Suppose a company wants to know the average satisfaction level of their customers. Instead of surveying all customers, they collect feedback from a random sample of customers and use inferential statistics to estimate the average satisfaction level of the entire customer base with a certain level of confidence.

In summary, descriptive statistics is about summarizing and describing the data at hand, while inferential statistics goes beyond the sample data to draw conclusions and make predictions about the larger population. Both types of statistics are crucial for data analysis and decision-making in various fields, including research, business, and science.

Q10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain
how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.
Ans. The common measures of central tendency are mean,mdedian,mode,variance,standard deviation and different type of distribution
     of data like histogram,pdf,pmf.

Q4. Categorise the following datasets with respect to quantitative and qualitative data types:

(i) Grading in exam: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, E <----------- qualitative Nominal data types 

(ii) Colour of mangoes: yellow, green, orange, red <------- qualitative Nominal data types 

(iii) Height data of a class: [178.9, 179, 179.5, 176, 177.2, 178.3, 175.8,...] <--------------continuous quantitative data type

(iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: [500, 600, 478, 672, ...] <--------- descrete quantitative data type
